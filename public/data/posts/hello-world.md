# The first blog post. 

Tadam! The first blog post was written. 
Who would have though that VS Code is a pretty decent text editor?
And that amazing little language even support code inserts: 

```javascript
    console.log("Hello World!"); 
```

Auto-correct would be nice, but I'm sure there's plugins that can help me turn VS Code into a real word processor!
Sure, some sort of visual editor would be nice, but this dirty hack of an "engine" was crafted in two days so there's that. 

# The next step?

Bug fixing would be a nice idea, but it's way funnier to play with **css** and discover new dopamine receptors doing so.
